    <h2>Tsurumi Ryokuchi Park</h2>
    <p><b>2017/03/19</b>, another <b>sunny</b>> day. After lunch, I decide to have a relex.</br>
    After searching by Google maps for a few minutes, a Park, <b>Tsurumi Ryokuchi Park</b> as I </br>
    write the title, makes me instristed. And it's not very long away, only one hour ride by train.</br>
    So I set off quickly after packaging my Canon 100D.</br>
    </br>
    <b>One hour later,</b> precisely 3 o'clock PM, I arrived the <b>Tsurumi Ryoukuchi Park</b>.</br>
    I felt very excited because I thought the <b>Sakura</b> was open by the fisrt sight. Actually,</br>
    It's found to be peach flowers. But, still beauful. Here it is.</br>

    </br>
    </br>
    <b>Then,</b> after walking around in the Park, I found my building style from all around the world, like </br>
    China, South Korea, Island, England, and so on. </br>

    </br>
    </br>
    <b>By</b> waling close to the lake in the centor of park, the beauty of pure yellow rape flowers stopped me. </br>
    The funny thing is that a big dog party is held there. Those cute things attracted too many fans.</br>
    I also took some photos of dog party. It looks they really enjoyed the show and became the focus </br> of park.

    <b>Flowers Unknown</b></br>
    </br>
    </br>
    <b>Time</b> really passed fast. Before I realised, it's 5 o'clock PM. As the Park closes in 6 o'clock, </br>
    I have to walk fast and look for the gate. Just by walking around the lake at the same time, I found </br>
    some bird were having a nice afternoon swim in the lake. As an old saying in Chinese, the ducks </br>
    firstly the warmth of spring water. If you don't understand, just see the picture as follow.</br>

    <h2>Osaka Castle</h2>
    <p>
    This is the third time that I went to Osaka Castle in <b>2017/03/05</b>.</br>
    Although got lost in middle way, I still feel happy and shocked by the beauty the castle gave me.</br>
    As the actual time is PM 2 o'clock, the light is a little gray. Sorry for that.</br>
